I wrote this code as an attempt to start a mouse tracking tool.
It is written in jQuery and simply stores mouse co-ordinates in an array when certian
jQuery mouse events are fired.

Possible improvements:
-Store recordings in a database for playback later
-Store a copy of the page being viewed to play back with.
-Playback recording within an iFrame, with controls for stepping through etc
-Create heatmaps from recorded data
