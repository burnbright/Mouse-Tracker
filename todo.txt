jQuery MouseTracker

Short-term to-do:

storage
-save data to database
-save record of pages member looked at
-store: url, sessionid, browser size, 

playback
-create a flash-based player?
-display webpage in an iframe

-Test with flash contetnt, complex floated / tabbed / animated content

Known bugs:
-player: scrolling appears to repeat itself
-player: mousedown/up only shows if you move the mouse after mousedown


Heatmaps ideas:
-need to account for different resolutions
-need to account for fluid layouts



Future ideas
-Real-time streaming of user interactions on a page. Realtime clickmap. Pathway use overview. Top-down view of website and interactions.





LaunchBug:
create member profiles based on pages they visit?
